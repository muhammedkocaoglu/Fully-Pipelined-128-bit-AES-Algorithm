# Fully-Pipelined-128-bit-AES-Algorithm

128 bit fully pipelined AES algorithm. After the pipeline gets full, it gives encrypted data at each clock. The design is tested using self-checking test bench. The results obtained in VHDL are compared with the results obtained in Matlab. The design is FPGA-proven as well. I tried the algorithm on my Arty A7 35T FPGA. 

The core is published at opencores.org as well. 

I will also add the simulation results soon.i
